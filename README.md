# Java Bootcamp Training - Class 1

Welcome to the Java Bootcamp! This repository contains exercises and examples from Class 1, covering fundamental Java programming concepts.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Core Concepts
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus
- **Comparison Operators**: Less than, greater than, equal to, not equal to
- **Logical Operators**: AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!)
- **Increment & Decrement**: Pre/post increment and decrement operations
- **Conditional Statements**: if, else if, else, and switch-case
- **Loops**: for, while, and do-while loops

## 📁 Files Overview

### 1. Calculator.java
A comprehensive demonstration of Java fundamentals including:
- **Arithmetic class**: Basic mathematical operations
- **Comparison class**: Relational operators demonstration
- **Logical class**: Boolean logic operations
- **incrementAndDecrement class**: Pre/post increment and decrement behavior
- **conditional class**: Age-based eligibility checks and switch-case statements
- **loops class**: Different loop types (for, while, do-while)

### 2. Task1.java
**ATM Withdrawal Simulation**
- Demonstrates nested conditional statements
- PIN verification logic
- Balance checking before withdrawal
- Real-world application of if-else statements

### 3. Task2.java
**Student Grading System**
- Grade calculation based on marks
- Uses if-else-if ladder structure
- Grading scale:
  - A: 90+
  - B: 80-89
  - C: 70-79
  - D: 60-69
  - Fail: Below 60

## 🚀 How to Run

### Compile
```bash
javac class1/*.java
```

### Run Individual Programs
```bash
java class1.Calculator
java class1.Task1
java class1.Task2
```

## 💡 Learning Objectives

By working through these examples, you will:
- Understand Java syntax and basic operations
- Master conditional logic and control flow
- Learn to use different types of loops effectively
- Apply programming concepts to real-world scenarios
- Build a strong foundation for advanced Java topics

## 🎯 Practice Exercises

Try modifying the code to:
1. Add more arithmetic operations (e.g., power, square root)
2. Implement different ATM scenarios (deposits, balance inquiry)
3. Create a more detailed grading system with letter grade descriptions
4. Experiment with nested loops and complex conditionals
